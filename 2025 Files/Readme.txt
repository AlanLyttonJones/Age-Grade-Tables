2025 Long Distance Running Tables
Again, working with Tom Bernhard who provided the single-age bests, the 2025 standards were developed. The standards are included in the GitHub repository in the '2025 Files" directory: FemaleRoadStd2025.xlxs and MaleRoadStd2025.xlxs.
The working files that produced the standards are included: maleRoad2025.xlxs and femaleRoad2025.xlxs.
For the 2025 tables, an improved interpolation scheme for computing age factors for the distances other than 5 km, 10 km, Half-Marathon, and Marathon. The standards are developed for 5 km, 10 km, Half-Marathon, and Marathon. Then the standards at all the other distances are computed by interpolation. For example, for the 6 km distance, the log of the difference between 10 km and 5 km  divided into the log of the distance between 6 km and 5 km. This number, which we call u, is between zero and one. It is used in the interpolation. Again, for the 6 km standards. The standard for each age is computed by taking the standard for the age at 5 km, S5, and the standard for that age at 10 km, S10 and using the formula to compute the standard at 6 km, S6.
	S6 = S5 (1 â€“ u) + S10u
The 2025 tables were approved on 2025-01-10 by the Masters Long Distance Running Council (MLDR) of USA Track and Field Federation
